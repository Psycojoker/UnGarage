Run your own irc server
-----------------------

If you want to set up your own irc server, I recommend you
`ngIRCd <http://ngircd.barton.de/index.php.en>`_. It is very easy
to configure (only one config file to edit and you're done) and really
stable. Thus, it is pkged in debian.

For debian(-based):

::

    apt-get install ngircd
